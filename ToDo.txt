This'll be a true ToDo list I will be writing out for me or others to work on.
I can't guarantee that any of these will actually get done, but I can at least write out ideas of what is planned.

Vanilla Things:
Character Selection Menu
New Freeplay Menu

Custom Things for Engine:
New tab in character menu for Note Strums, Splashes, and even Health Bars. Also add button to disable RGB Shader override for all of these.
