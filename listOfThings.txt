Imported:
- All of my custom objects in case I want to use them
- Vanilla based Results Screen with a bit of customizabity for other characters
- Vanilla FNF Soundtray through some jank rerouting

Added:
- Added "musicAsString" function to Paths
- Added "getDirectory" and "getDirectoryFile" functions to Paths
- My own Haxe library
- New, improved, zoom function
- My custom noteskin for others to use

Updates:
- Updated FlxAnimate to the newest version, also fixed issues with other ones in specific stages
- Updated sound, music, inst, soundRandom, getPath, and getTextFromFile functions in Paths file to include the option to use libraries/parent folders
- Three new base stage functions that utilize the Paths.currentLevel thing to ensure nothing breaks on accident ("playWeekSound" - plays a sound in the week folder, "playWeekMusic" - plays music in the week folder, "randomWeekSound" - plays a random sound provided)
- Updated both versions of monster to have left and right animations swapped

Plans/ToDo:
- Per character based Note Colors, will be a client pref and will be set in the character editor
- Specific noteskins for characters if toggle is enabled
- Disable RGB shader on notes if character overrides it
- The three things above but also for notesplashes
- Character Based Note Colors Client Pref will be a list: enabled, opponent only, and disabled. Opponent only would allow the player to still use their own colors.
- Rewrite my Character Menu to match the Vanilla Character Menu
- Implement the new Freeplay Menu from Vanilla FNF
- Implement my custom healthbar that allows for other images to be used between characters
