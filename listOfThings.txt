Implemented:
- Results Screen
- Vanilla FNF Soundtray

Imported:
- All of my custom objects in case I want to use them

Added:
- Added "musicAsString" function to Paths
- Added "getDirectory" and "getDirectoryFile" functions to Paths

Updates:
- Updated FlxAnimate to the newest version, also fixed issues with other ones in specific stages
- Updated sound, music, inst, soundRandom, getPath, and getTextFromFile to include the option to use libraries/parent folders
- Three new base stage functions that utilize the Paths.currentLevel thing to ensure nothing breaks on accident ("playWeekSound" - plays a sound in the week folder, "playWeekMusic" - plays music in the week folder, "randomWeekSound" - plays a random sound provided)

Plans/ToDo:
- Per character based Note Colors, will be a client pref and will be set in the character editor
- Specific noteskins for characters if toggle is enabled
- Disable RGB shader on notes if character overrides it
- Rewrite my Character Menu to match the Vanilla Character Menu
- Implement the new Freeplay Menu from Vanilla FNF
