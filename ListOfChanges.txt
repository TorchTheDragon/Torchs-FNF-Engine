This text file is just a way to keep things in order of what was updated or added. Side note... I may not keep them in order on accident... sorry.

Updated FlxAnimate to the newest version
Fixed issues with older FlxAnimate objects in specific stages

Updated sound, music, inst, soundRandom, getPath, and getTextFromFile functions in Paths file to include the option to use libraries/parent folders
Three new base stage functions that utilize the Paths.currentLevel thing to ensure nothing breaks on accident ("playWeekSound" - plays a sound in the week folder, "playWeekMusic" - plays music in the week folder, "randomWeekSound" - plays a random sound provided)
Added a new and improved zoom event
Included my custom noteskin for others to use
Updated both versions of monster to have left and right animations swapped

Added "changeRGB" to PixelSplashShaderRef in NoteSplash.hx
Character based Note Colors, Note Splash Colors, and Strum Cover Colors, set in Character Editor

Reflected Character object added to BaseStage.hx
Added Strum Skin selection in Visual options
Custom healthbar Client Pref
Fixed strum covers staying longer than they should be on short sustains
Added Alt Note Color Support for Notes, Strum Notes, Note Splashes, and Strum Covers
Added event for strum covers and note splashes for opponent
Added custom note skin and texture library support for character based note skins and colors
IN DEV - Cursor that changes based on what it is overlapping
Ability to change the Camera and Position of Rating and Combo count
Added ability to use ABot, or Nene's Speaker, on any stage
Made Blazin Middlescroll
Added Wobbly Notes as an event
Reflected Char has Atlas character support now, meaning it can work on spritemaps now instead of just spritesheets
Added ability to mess with the window's title and color (Windows 10 and Windows 11 only I think)
Added a custom note type for a ghost effect
Added Cinematic Bars Event
Added ability on Healthbar to have it smoothly move instead of an immediate jump when gaining or losing health
Added ability to use Winning Icons on characters
From JorgeX_YT from Reanimated - Added Credits to the intros of songs (It's a toggle). I won't be adding the default ones as I personally don't know who the song artists are nor do I know the charters.
BIG UPDATE - UPDATED TO FLXANIMATE 4.0.0 FOR BETTER COMPATIBILITY WITH FLXANIMATE OBJECTS, example being shaders
Made ABot actually able to use shaders
Fixed Custom Character Note RGB from editing the colors of Custom Notes like the Hurt Note.
Completely Revamped ImageBar for better customizabity as well as being able to edit everything through a json instead of hard coding it.
Made the ABot speaker's visualizer update with current volume level
Ghost Effect has an alt note variant
Ghost Effect will use scaling method if slideDistance is set to 0
Ghost Effect values can be changed via an event
ImageBar can now be lerped if the "healthLerp" variable is set to true in it
Custom Window Titles added to multiple states... I still have more to do lol
CUSTOM NOTES FOR CHARACTERS ACTUALLY HAS MOD SUPPORT LESSSSSS GO.... I changed how "Paths.getSparrowAtlas" works a small bit, not a major change to its functionality really. "Reload Notes" may break after 2-3 times of changing the image, but a quick reload into the state fixes it.
Added color bars to the Note Colors tab in the Character Editor (This change was present... I just forgot to record it here...)

EVERYTHING BEFORE THIS WAS ON PSYCH 1.0 ENGINE, AFTER THIS LINE IS STUFF I HAVE ADDED SINCE I UPDATED MY ENGINE TO PSYCH 1.0.1
Updated a lot of titles for several menus
Added Icon Dancing - Lawornot
Fixed a crash with icon dancing
^^^ RELEASE 0.1.0 ^^^

UPDATE TO PSYCH 1.0.2
Fix Tankman cutscene messing up camera afterwards
UPDATE TO PSYCH 1.0.2h
UPDATE TO PSYCH 1.0.3
UPDATE TO PSYCH 1.0.4.... FINALLY UP TO DATE lol, any future updates will be mine or other peoples additions... which I really hope that other people in the community will help out
Fixed strum notes ending early on Left, Down, and Right note in pixel mode... firstly, never realized that, secondly, why was only Up setup correctly for that?
Renamed WindowTitleUtils.hx to WindowUtils.hx
Added transparent background (kinda) to WindowUtils.hx (WINDOWS ONLY IT SEEMS)
Updated my haxe library/Updated TorchsFunctions to 0.7.0 using some utils I had from this engine
Fully changed most of the Psych things to say Torch now, like charts and what not since this does use more events than Psych does
Changed minSustainLength math for StrumCovers
IN DEV - Speaker Skins... seems functional to a point just need to implement it
Small Results screen fixes
Added pixel ABot
Added random RTX Lighing Shader test thing, not really soft coded but can be used in hard code... unless I dumb lol
Fixed a weirdly specific crash when game loads notes. Aka, going into a pixel stage AFTER loading a non pixel stage using a skin that doesn't have a pixel variant. So you'd load the non-pixel variant, it would register it as a valid skin, then you go to pixel stage, instead of checking if a pixel version existed, it assumed there was one because skin was valid... that was the issue.
Reenabled the videos in Project.xml
^^^ RELEASE 0.1.2 ^^^ // I was gonna mark this as 0.1.1, but I forgot to actually release it after updating it to Psych 1.0.4... my bad...

Fixed Videos crashing game... kind of... I forced the "Paths.clearUnusedMemory();" in stages, that's it
Adjusted Strum Cover Length Math
Speaker Skins work and are built into the BaseStage by default... alignments of the speakers though... that needs to be adjusted - [W.I.P.]
Updated Stage Template file to inform about Speaker Skin usage
Base Speaker and Christmas Speaker alignments added [Speaker Skin W.I.P.]
